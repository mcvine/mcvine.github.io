<h2> News </h2>
The introductory paper, version 2, was posted to arXiv:
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02776">
  MCViNE -- An object oriented Monte Carlo neutron ray tracing simulation package
</a>

<h2> Development Team </h2>

<h2> Funding </h2>
The development of the MCViNE software was begun under
the DANSE project supported by the NSF award DMR-0520547.
Continuing development and research on applications of MCViNE
have been supported by
the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences.
